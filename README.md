#####
Data
#####
The dataset is the file 'emp_access_challenge_free.csv'


####
Instructions for running the code
####
The code can be run locally if scipy, pandas, NumPy, and time packages are installed in the system. Just make
sure that the dataset, 'emp_access_challenge_free.csv' is in the same folder as the code.
 
1) Open Google Colab notebook.
2) Save a copy to Drive if you want to save your changes.
3) Upload the file 'emp_access_challenge_free.csv' to the Google Colab notebook in the content folder.
4) Create a folder called result under the content folder in the notebook.
5) Click on runtime in the toolbar and then click run all.
6) Once the run is complete, the folder named result will have the sampled dataset, platform rankings, and the output file.
